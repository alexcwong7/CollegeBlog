      <h3><a href="demand.html">High Tuition Due to Supply and Demand</a></h3>
      <p class="text-muted">Wednesday, 24 April 2019</p>
      <img class="previewimg img-fluid rounded" src="img/collegecampus.jpg" alt="College Campus">
      <p>A college degree is seen by many people as a necessity for any profession in today's job market. Colleges are able to set their tuition prices to whatever they want because of this high demand. Not all jobs actually need a college degree, which causes students to strive for degrees that are less than useful. For some, there is a fear of failure if they don't get a college education. Before deciding to go to college, one should think about their career paths and determine if a college degree is actually required. A college degree is not the best investment for some people because of the high costs involved and not much return.</p>

      <h3><a href="loans.html">Federal Aid Contributes to the Problem</a></h3>
      <p class="text-muted">Friday, 26 April 2019</p>
      <img class="previewimg img-fluid rounded" src="img/loans.jpg" alt="Bank Account Notes">
      <p>Today, the rising cost of college tuition is just not affordable for most individuals.
         However, students are able to attend college and receive their higher education through the help of federal student aid.
         Federal student aid helps to alleviate the costs, who otherwise might not have been able to finance their education.
         Unexpectedly, this just raises tuition costs even more.
