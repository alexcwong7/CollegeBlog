    <p>There are many other costs students must consider in addition to their tuition.
       Let us list some of these factors in a table below and then analyze them.</p>

    </table>
    <br>
    <p>Let's start with the bigger costs: meal plan and housing.
       Most colleges require freshmen to live on campus for their first year, so they are already going to take a big hit.
       On campus housing costs are very high. They are able to charge a high amount because of convenience - you're only a few minutes away from your classes.
       Everything is about convenience and availability. This also applies to on campus markets and restaurants.
       Prices are marked up and they know people will buy them because they can't get it elsewhere unless they travel off campus, which takes time out of their day.
       Meal plans utilize a strategy called <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/27579/concepts/transactional-utility/">transactional utility</a> for students to spend more money.
       This describes the happiness a consumer gets from the perceived value of the deal.
       You put a lot of money down in a plan and in return you get slight discounts on purchases when you use your plan.
       Prices are marked up, then the meal plan provides a small discount, providing satisfaction to the student, spending more than they would like to and thinking they are getting a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>Next we will cover textbooks and other supplies.
       Books, like tuition, have also seen an increase in price.
       Everyone knows that classes (most) need textbooks. Manufacturers hike up the price on their textbooks.
       They make deals with colleges to use their book and in return they get a cut of the profits.
       Students will be forced to buy these expensive textbooks because they need it to pass the class.
       Luckily, a lot of colleges will buy back the textbooks... at extreme low-ball prices.
       Colleges actually make most of their money through the used textbook market rather than new ones.
       Students, for whatever reason, sell back their textbooks to the school, that they bought for say $200, and get $10 in return.
       Colleges make massive profit off this, reselling the textbooks in their store, marking up the book to only a small discount off original price.
    </p>
    <p>Lastly, we will analyze the hundreds of fees. Almost everything has a fee.
       You can get charged a fee just for being a freshman. Ridiculous right? But you probably didn't see it.
       When you get billed they try to make the fees as little noticeable as possible.
       Students, unknowingly, are paying for services they don't even know about.
       A lot of services on campus are listed as "free" because you have already paid for them.
       For example, the recreation center, downloadable software like Microsoft Office, library, etc.
       These are all free for students, only because you have been charged a fee already.
