    <h2 class="articletitle">High Tuition Due to Supply and Demand</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">Wednesday, 24 April 2019</p>

    <p>A college degree is seen by many people as a necessity for any profession in today's job market.
       Colleges are able to set their tuition prices to whatever they want because of this high demand.
       Not all jobs actually need a college degree, which causes students to strive for degrees that are less than useful.
       For some, there is a fear of failure if they don't get a college education.
       Before deciding to go to college, one should think about their career paths and determine if a college degree is actually required.
       A college degree is not the best investment for some people because of the high costs involved and not much return.
    </p>
    <p>Higher costs are also due to the perceived notion that higher cost = higher quality.
       Students are willing to pay the extra dollars to attend a more "prestigous" university.
       If they are already going to be paying thousands of dollars, what harm does a little extra do?
       This thought process causes an increased student debt, which is harder for them to dig themselves out of.
     </p>
    <p>As enrollment dramatically increases, more professors are needed to accommodate the influx of students.
       Hiring highly educated individuals is a very hard process and can be very costly.
       Universities raise tuition prices to help pay for these additional professors.
       They also try to cut costs on themselves by fitting more students in already crowded classes.
    </p>
    <p>The hike in enrollment numbers also have an effect on state funding.
       States can't keep up with the exponential increase in numbers and they provide less, while students pay more.
       Around 80% of students attend public institutions so it has a large impact.
       Private colleges are more expensive, but public colleges are slowly reaching to the same expense level.
       State funding for higher public education has been cut and colleges are forced to replace this with higher tuition costs.
