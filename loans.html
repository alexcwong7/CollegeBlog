    <h2 class="articletitle">Federal Student Aid Contributes to the Problem</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">Friday, 26 April 2019</p>
    <hr>
    <img class="articleimg img-fluid rounded" src="img/loans.jpg" alt="Student Loans">
    <p>Today, the rising cost of college tuition is just not affordable for most individuals.
       However, students are able to attend college and receive their higher education through the help of federal student aid.
       Federal student aid helps to alleviate the costs, who otherwise might not have been able to finance their education.
       Unexpectedly, this just raises tuition costs even more.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, student aid is everywhere and it is easily obtainable by students. This includes grants and loans.
       Grants you don't have to pay back, but it still doesn't help the overall problem.
       It is a never ending cycle. More aid becomes available, the more the tuition increases.
       This contributes to the fact that colleges are able to keep their tuition high because they know they will still be able to attract students.
    </p>
    <p>Students, knowing they can just take out loans, causes them to ignore the big numbers in front of them.
       Students tend to think in the short term.
       They will accept any aid they can get and don't think about the debt they will have to pay off after they receive their degree.
       They think that you can get any college degree and they will be able to pay it off immediately.
       Unfortunately, this is not the case.
       For the duration of their education, everything is jolly, until they graduate and the burden is placed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
       Many students are in debt.
       Student loan debt in the United States is sitting over $1.5 trillion dollars.
       Students must choose their career path wisely and think long term financial risks.
       When you take out a loan, you are just borrowing money. You have to pay it off eventually.
       For some majors, it will be a lot harder and take a lot longer to pay off their debt.
       Paying off your loans is very hard due to high interest rates that will keep increasing until you pay it off.
